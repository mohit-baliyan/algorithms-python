KNN ( K Nearest Neighbors ), RNN ( Radius Nearest Neighbors ), PCA (in matlab also), Linear, Polynomial, Ridge( L1 ), Lasso( L2 ), Elastic net and Logistic regression have been built from scratch in python and later results have been compared with sklearn for assertion. These codes were written for self mathematical understanding during my grad.
